# Applied-Cryptography
This repository contains various concepts that are used in cryptography such as Symmetric and Asymmetric cyphers (and decrypters), hash functions, and key establishments.

The repository is separated by concepts and include excersies and their solutions both provided in the appropriate folder. It is worthy to note that CryptoTools.java is a java file used across multiple (if not all the) files and contains functions used for unit conversion and different useful get functions. While all the exercise solutions were written by myself, CryptoTools.java was written by York University's Professor Hamzeh Roumani.
